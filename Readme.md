# About

This is a fork from https://github.com/afriggeri/cv
There are many forks from this source. 
I doubt that mine will help you more than their's.

I've added a footer (I could trim or use the space - so I used the space).

There are a few kludges built in, e.g., played with entry lists for correct paging (other forks have solved this). This does add color to more (than 5) section headers.

However, color is manually added in some cases.

Latest version of my CV, typesetted in Helvetica and using colors inspired by Monokai (there is an `print` option which renders in black and white, and reverts the header to dark on light, if printing on paper is needed).

Uses TikZ for the header, XeTeX and fontspec to use Helvetica Neue, biblatex to print my publications and textpos for the aside.
