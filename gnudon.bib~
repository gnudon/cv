	abstract = {Many have suggested that tinkering plays a critical role in novices learning to program, and recent work in learning analytics (Baker \& Yacef, 2009 Blikstein, 2011) allows us to describe new relationships in the process. Using learning analytics, we explore how students progress from exploration, through tinkering, to refinement, a pathway that we term {EXTIRE.} The work contributes to learning sciences by: showing empirical support for previously theorized processes; identifying a role of tinkering in novices' learning; and presenting a data-driven approach to creating process descriptions. Furthermore, our findings illuminate how tinkering can be a valuable approach for novices.},
